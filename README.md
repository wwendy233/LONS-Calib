An extrinsic calibration framework of LiDAR and omnidirectional camera, specifically targeting panoramic annular lenses and fisheye lenses capable of capturing negative space information. It also supports cameras with narrower fields of view, such as pinhole cameras. 

The toolbox will be open source after the paper is accepted. Thank you for your understanding!
