# LONS-Calib

An extrinsic calibration framework of LiDAR and omnidirectional camera, specifically targeting panoramic annular lenses and fisheye lenses capable of capturing negative space information (z<0). It also supports cameras with narrower fields of view, such as pinhole cameras. 

The toolbox will be open source after the paper is accepted. Thank you for your understanding!
